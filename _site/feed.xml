&lt;p&gt;Although Gary is ready to have the Impella heart pump removed, the removal has been postponed until some time tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As most of you know, Gary suffered a “widowmaker” heart attack on Thursday and is currently on life support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, he was with rescue when he coded and was able to receive CPR immediately. He was placed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chop.edu/treatments/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo&quot;&gt;ECMO&lt;/a&gt; and we believe it has saved his life. Gary came off ECMO on Monday, but he is still intubated and on an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abiomed.com/impella&quot;&gt;Impella&lt;/a&gt; heart pump and is on dialysis. He has been able to respond to commands, but is mostly incoherent and agitated over the intubation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some other complications, there have been great daily improvements. He has a long battle ahead of him, but we have faith and hope that he will recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has become overwhelming updating everyone individually so we have put together this web page to keep all of our concerned friends and family members up to date on Gary’s progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We appreciate all of your support and we will try to post updates about Gary’s progress once or twice per day to keep you all informed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, thank you all for your support during this difficult time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kimberly, Melissa, Brieonna, Michael and Brandon&lt;/p&gt;
