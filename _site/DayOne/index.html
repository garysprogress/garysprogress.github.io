<p>As most of you know, Gary suffered a “widowmaker” heart attack on Thursday and is currently on life support.</p>

<p>Fortunately, he was with rescue when he coded and was able to receive CPR immediately. He was placed on <a href="https://www.chop.edu/treatments/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo">ECMO</a> and we believe it has saved his life. Gary came off ECMO on Monday, but he is still intubated and on an <a href="http://www.abiomed.com/impella">Impella</a> heart pump and is on dialysis. He has been able to respond to commands, but is mostly incoherent and agitated over the intubation.</p>

<p>Despite some other complications, there have been great daily improvements. He has a long battle ahead of him, but we have faith and hope that he will recover.</p>

<p>It has become overwhelming updating everyone individually so we have put together this web page to keep all of our concerned friends and family members up to date on Gary’s progress.</p>

<p>We appreciate all of your support and we will try to post updates about Gary’s progress once or twice per day to keep you all informed.</p>

<p>Again, thank you all for your support during this difficult time.</p>
