## Today's update

The intubation tube has finally been removed and Gary is now breathing on his own.

He is currently using an oxygen mask that is treating the swelling and irritation in his throat with a cool air mist.

He's resting not so comfortably and is a little agitated by not being allowed to talk. The doctors have asked him to refrain from speaking for a few hours.

Gary was able to get a couple of words in though after the doctor denied his request for some ice. The doctor told Gary "nope, can't have that right now sorry" and he responded with "oh fuck."

Gary is back.
