## Morning update

Last night, a procedure was done to remove some more fluid from Gary's lungs.

He is slightly more coherent and has shown, by nodding his head and blinking his eyes, that he recognizes Kimberly.

The heart pump is still scheduled to be removed later today, so we will provide another update after that procedure.
