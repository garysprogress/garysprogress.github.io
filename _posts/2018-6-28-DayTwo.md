## Evening update

The heart pump (Impella) has successfully been removed and Gary is doing very well. The doctors believe he is making great progress and doing well without the heart pump.

Gary is able to answer direct questions by blinking and nodding. Vitals are improving and we are hopeful that he will have the intubation tube removed within the next few days.

The doctors have decided to sedate him for the night so he can relax post-procedure. For the rest of this evening and throughout the day tomorrow, they're primary goal is to increase the dialysis fluid removal rate.

## Morning update

Last night, a procedure was done to remove some more fluid from Gary's lungs.

He is slightly more coherent and has shown, by nodding his head and blinking his eyes, that he recognizes Kimberly.

The heart pump is still scheduled to be removed later today, so we will provide another update after that procedure.
