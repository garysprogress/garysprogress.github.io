## Morning update

Happy 4th!

Yesterday was very exciting, mainly because Gary's speech improved drastically from the day before. He's cooperative, more aware, and much easier to understand and communicate with.

A speech therapist came in and worked with Gary to improve his speech and ability to swallow. We hope he'll be able to start eating and drinking on his own today, eliminating the need for the feeding tube in his nose. The therapist also asked him a bunch of questions to test his cognition; he did very well.

Gary is still experiencing some confusion and hallucinations, but his personality that we all know and love, is really starting to shine through.
