## Evening update

Gary's vitals are gradually improving and bilirubin levels dropping.

He says that he's "aggravated, angry, and annoyed" by his condition, lack of sleep, and not being able to eat or drink. The feeding tube will likely stay in for at least another day.

Today he had more physical and speech therapy as well as another dialysis treatment.

## Morning update

Happy 4th!

Yesterday was very exciting, mainly because Gary's speech improved drastically from the day before. He's cooperative, more aware, and much easier to understand and communicate with.

A speech therapist came in and worked with Gary to improve his speech and ability to swallow. We hope he'll be able to start eating and drinking on his own today, eliminating the need for the feeding tube in his nose. The therapist also asked him a bunch of questions to test his cognition; he did very well.

Gary is still experiencing some confusion and hallucinations, but his personality that we all know and love is really starting to shine through.
