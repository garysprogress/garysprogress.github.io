## Today's update

What a day! Gary has finally been moved out of the ICU.

The progress he has made over the past week is amazing. He's coherent, communicating effectively, and seems to understand everything that's going on.

His kidneys are still not working though, therefore, the dialysis treatments will continue.

For the next couple of weeks, Gary will mainly be working on improving his hand-eye coordination, dexterity, and strength. He has already started standing and walking a little on his own, but still has a way to go.
