## Afternoon update

Pretty soon Gary could be the one writing these updates. He is getting better at using the phone and iPad every day, and is reading much faster.

After being stuck in a bed for over two weeks, he was very happy and excited this morning when he completed a walk around the hallway of the hospital. He walked half of it with a walker and the other half all by himself.

Gary is making great progress and is ready for visitors again, but it is tiring for him. Contact Kimberly to figure out a time for a short visit if you'd like to come by.

Thank you for your support and concern, Gary certainly appreciates it.
