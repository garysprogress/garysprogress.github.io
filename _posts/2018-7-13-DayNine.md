## Today's update

Gary was moved to the rehabilitation institute at Memorial Regional Hospital South last night. He will spend the next week there, working with therapists to get him back on his feet. He has been very lethargic lately and is suffering from a chronic dry cough.

To get back to normal, Gary will need to put in the work and stay motivated throughout his therapy. The doctors have done their part and saved Gary's life, the rest is up to him - the speed of recovery is directly proportional to the effort he puts in.
