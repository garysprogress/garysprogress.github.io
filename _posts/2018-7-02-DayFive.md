## Afternoon update

Apologies for not posting an update yesterday. Gary spent most of the day resting and finally getting some sleep after being awake for three days in a row. We believe the lack of sleep may have also contributed to his confusion and delirium, so we're glad he finally slept.

Today Gary's bilirubin levels seem to have plateaued and even dropped a bit. He had to be sedated again for a procedure that involved placing a dialysis catheter in his chest. Gary will now be on dialysis every one to two days for about 3-4 hours, instead of 24/7.

Mentally, he has some lucid moments, but is for the most part incoherent. We hope this will change with time, especially once the medications and toxins have been flushed from his body.

For now, we wait.
