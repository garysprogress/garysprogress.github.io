### Today's update

Although Gary is ready to have the Impella heart pump removed, the removal has been postponed until some time tomorrow.

As most of you know, Gary suffered a "widowmaker" heart attack on Thursday and is currently on life support.

Fortunately, he was with rescue when he coded and was able to receive CPR immediately. He was placed on [ECMO](https://www.chop.edu/treatments/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-ecmo) and we believe it has saved his life. Gary came off ECMO on Monday, but he is still intubated and on an [Impella](http://www.abiomed.com/impella) heart pump and is on dialysis. He has been able to respond to commands, but is mostly incoherent and agitated over the intubation.

Despite some other complications, there have been great daily improvements. He has a long battle ahead of him, but we have faith and hope that he will recover.

It has become overwhelming updating everyone individually so we have put together this web page to keep all of our concerned friends and family members up to date on Gary's progress.

We appreciate all of your support and we will try to post updates about Gary's progress once or twice per day to keep you all informed.

Again, thank you all for your support during this difficult time.
