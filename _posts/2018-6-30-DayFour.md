## Evening update

Gary has been having a tough time today.

He is experiencing some of the symptoms that are commonly seen in patients who have been sedated for a long period of time. He is delirious, not completely coherent, and his speech is not fully comprehensible. These symptoms are partially a result of his high [bilirubin](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/bilirubin-test#1) levels.

He had a full body CT scan this afternoon and the results came back great. The doctors are suggesting that the bilirubin will eventually be reabsorbed by the body and/or be cleared out by dialysis. This process will take some time.

Due to his current state, we respectfully request that all visitation be postponed until further notice.

We appreciate everyone's care and concern, but Gary needs to get the rest he requires for his recovery.

Thank you for your understanding. We will post another update tomorrow.
